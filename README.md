Hi, I am Bohrium, a student now in secondary education/High School (as American people call it). I love science, especially chemistry and (of course) CS! When I am not doing that/school, I play the violin/viola (choose one), attempt to not be a failure and practice 40 hrs a day, and stan ENHYPEN (a K-pop boy band) and TXT (another K-pop boy band). 


I wrote a couple of applications to help with my high school career, including:

 * [Paper scraper](https://github.com/bohrium2b/paper_scraper) - a script to download CAIE past papers from Papacambridge.
 * [Paper reader](https://bohrium2b/paper_reader_web)
