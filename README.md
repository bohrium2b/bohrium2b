# Hi!!!

Hi, I am Bohrium, a student now in secondary education/High School (as American people call it). I love science, especially chemistry and (of course) CS! When I am not doing that/school, I play the violin/viola (choose one), attempt to not be a failure and practice 40 hrs a day, and stan ENHYPEN (a K-pop boy band) and ${+}{\times}{+}$ (another K-pop boy band).
