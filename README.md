# Hi!!!

Hi, I am Bohrium, a student now in secondary education/High School (as American people call it). I love science, especially chemistry and (of course) CS! When I am not doing that/school, I play the violin/viola (choose one), attempt to not be a failure and practice 40 hrs a day, and stan ENHYPEN (a K-pop boy band) and TXT (another K-pop boy band). 


I wrote a couple of applications to help with my high school career, including:

 * [Paper scraper](https://github.com/bohrium2b/paper_scraper) - a script to download CAIE past papers from Papacambridge.
 * [Paper reader](https://github.com/bohrium2b/paper_reader_web) - a MUI frontend to paper_scraper
 * [Chess Chicken Sexing (CCS)](https://github.com/daltonma/chess_position_trainer) - A python script to take in a chess game database in PGN format, and output a directory containing lots of svg images of valid chess positions, as well as a json file describing the strength of each position. It also has an accompanying server written using flask on the backend and jQuery on the frontend (in a SPA, no less!)
